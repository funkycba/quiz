# quiz
I was able to get some functions to work for the start of the quiz but the points are not registering like they are supposed to.
The quiz is supposed to have a simple format that reveals each question from top to bottom which only goes as far as the second question. The timer is working fine but not all of the buttons are taking the "wrong" event listener and deducting seconds.
I am definitely going to have to make some adjustments and if I cannot make it work in time, I am going to have to submit it incomplete and resubmit once I have it finished.
