# quiz
I was able to get some functions to work for the start of the quiz but the points are not registering like they are supposed to.
The quiz is supposed to have a simple format that reveals each question from top to bottom which only goes as far as the second question. The timer is working fine but not all of the buttons are taking the "wrong" event listener and deducting seconds
